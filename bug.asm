mov eax, [ebx + ecx*4 + 0x10]

This line of assembly code attempts to access memory at an address calculated as the sum of the value in EBX, the product of ECX and 4, and 0x10.  The bug lies in the potential for an integer overflow if the intermediate calculations exceed the maximum value representable by the registers involved.  This would result in an incorrect memory address being accessed, leading to unpredictable behavior, such as segmentation faults, incorrect data manipulation, or program crashes.  The exact behavior would be highly dependent on the system and the specific values in the registers at the time of execution.
